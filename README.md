The computer gets a number of random digits different from each other (from 3 to 6). The player is given several attempts to guess this number.
After each attempt, the computer reports the number of matched digits standing out of place, as well as the number of correct digits in their places.
For example:
'The hidden number: 56478'
'The player's guess: 52976'
'the answer: the matched digits are not in their places - 1 (6), the digits are in their places - 2 (5 and 7)'

the game is played until the end of the number of moves or before guessing

The mage Evstafi is fighting a monster.
Each turn, the computer (Monster) randomly selects one of the available actions and informs what it is going to do. 
In response to this, the player (Evstafi) must choose his attack.

After that, mutual damage is inflicted. 
Magic armor blocks magic damage, physical armor blocks physical damage.
After performing an action, it cannot be re-selected during cooldown moves.

The battle goes on until one of the opponents wins.

Before the start of the battle, the player chooses the difficulty (the initial health of Eustace)
